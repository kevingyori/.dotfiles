Stuff I still want to andjust in my nvim config
 - [x] unmap <C-K> as I've remapped it to gh (hover)
 - [ ] telescope live grep sometimes doesn't work in specific folders
 - [x] whichkey appears too soon - timeoutlen is too low
 - [ ] don't open neotree after opening nvim
 - [x] show current file in neotree
 - [ ] add whichkey group descriptions
