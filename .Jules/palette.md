## 2026-02-20 - [Trust Through Feedback]
**Learning:** Terminal actions like "config reload" are invisible. Users often press the key multiple times just to be sure. Adding a simple confirmation message ("Config reloaded 🚀") builds immediate trust and removes cognitive load.
**Action:** Always add visual feedback (toast, status message, or color change) to invisible system actions.

## 2026-03-12 - [Unsaved State Visibility]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, users can easily lose track of unsaved modifications because visual cues are often minimal compared to GUI apps. A persistent "Unsaved" indicator prevents data loss and builds confidence.
**Action:** Always implement a clear visual indicator (e.g., `*` or `[Unsaved]`) for dirty states in TUI forms or editors.

## 2026-02-22 - [Preserving Context in TUI]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, replacing the entire screen for a simple input or confirmation destroys context. Users forget what they were acting on (e.g., "Was I deleting 'google.com' or 'google-analytics.com'?"). Keeping the list visible while showing the input/dialog at the bottom feels much more grounded and less disorienting.
**Action:** Avoid full-screen mode switches for simple transient tasks in TUIs. Overlay or append UI elements instead.

## 2024-05-24 - [Contextual Empty States]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, substituting a list with an empty state message can cause the layout to collapse or bounce if filler lines are not preserved. Differentiating between "No items managed" and "No items match search" provides critical context to the user.
**Action:** Always provide context-aware empty states (empty list vs empty search) and ensure layout height consistency by adjusting filler blank lines dynamically.
