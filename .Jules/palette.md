## 2026-02-20 - [Trust Through Feedback]
**Learning:** Terminal actions like "config reload" are invisible. Users often press the key multiple times just to be sure. Adding a simple confirmation message ("Config reloaded 🚀") builds immediate trust and removes cognitive load.
**Action:** Always add visual feedback (toast, status message, or color change) to invisible system actions.

## 2026-03-12 - [Unsaved State Visibility]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, users can easily lose track of unsaved modifications because visual cues are often minimal compared to GUI apps. A persistent "Unsaved" indicator prevents data loss and builds confidence.
**Action:** Always implement a clear visual indicator (e.g., `*` or `[Unsaved]`) for dirty states in TUI forms or editors.

## 2026-02-22 - [Preserving Context in TUI]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, replacing the entire screen for a simple input or confirmation destroys context. Users forget what they were acting on (e.g., "Was I deleting 'google.com' or 'google-analytics.com'?"). Keeping the list visible while showing the input/dialog at the bottom feels much more grounded and less disorienting.
**Action:** Avoid full-screen mode switches for simple transient tasks in TUIs. Overlay or append UI elements instead.

## 2026-03-24 - [Context-Aware Empty States in TUIs]
**Learning:** In TUI applications, missing empty states should be replaced with helpful guidance and call-to-actions (e.g., 'No domains managed yet. Press 'a' to add one.') to improve usability. Empty state messaging should be contextually differentiated to clarify whether the overall list is completely empty versus when a search filter simply yields no results.
**Action:** Always provide context-aware empty state messaging with clear call-to-actions in TUI lists, and ensure layout jumping is prevented by adjusting padding logic when these messages are displayed.
